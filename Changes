1.20  Mon Sep 01 12:00:00 2003
	- Run the forward lookups of MX records through the
	  Net::DNS resolver object to detect slow lookups
	  within the timeout restricted.  The normal
	  gethostbyname did not honor the timeout.
	- Taint cleaner.
	- Add procmail filter example.

1.19  Sat Mar 08 12:00:00 2003
	- Correct syntax for Net::Ping::ping and nack.
	- Avoids a problem when the MX entry does not resolve.
	- Prevent this crash: "Usage> nack($failed_ack_host)"
	- Bug reported by peter@hiplists.com (Peter Beltemacchi)

1.18  Tue Dec 10 20:00:00 2002
	- Latest version broke MAIL/RCPT check. Stupid, stupid, stupid
	  me - it actually caused failure of one test in test suite
	  but I misinterpreted it and though that mailboxes at
	  hotmail.com cannot be verified by Mail::CheckUser
	  anymore. Note to myself - never release anything in hurry.
	  Reported by Kevin Cassidy and fixed independently by Rob
	  Brown.
	- Added $Treat_Full_As_Fail config variable and new check code
	  CU_MAILBOX_FULL to report full boxes (Rob Brown).

1.17  Sat Nov 30 23:02:20 2002
	- Be polite with SMTP servers - try to issue QUIT command
	  before disconnecting. Suggested by Tom Allison.
	- Workaround Perl bug (#18784) which causes userpart regexp
	  matching failures with correct userparts in Perl 5.8.0.
	  Patch by Rodger Bagnall.
	- Remove notice that MAIL/RCPT check works with mailboxes
	  on hotmail.com from documentation. It seems it is not
	  true anymore.

1.16  Wed Nov 18 09:30:00 2002
	- Add $Mail::CheckUser::Net_DNS_Resolver feature
	  to allow customizeable Net::DNS::Resolver object.
	- Utilize udp_timeout feature in Net::DNS
	  to avoid excessive dns delays (Rob Brown).
	- Do not allow "special" characters in username.
	- Break RFC by allowing domains with "--"

1.15  Fri Nov  8 00:02:23 2002
	- Minor documentaion and code fixes.

1.14  Sat Oct 19 23:59:00 2002
	- A little more robust for when some mail servers are down.
	- Uses Net::Ping to determine remote reachability.
	- Added setting $Mail::CheckUser::Skip_SYN
	  to retain the old 1.13 functionality.
	- Patches by bbb@cpan.org (Rob Brown)

1.13  Sat Mar  9 23:59:00 2002
	- I had to bump version because of corrupted CPAN upload.

1.12  Sat Mar  9 23:50:33 2002
	- Fix die if all SMTP servers for mail domain are found as
	  unreachable during SMTP checks. Thanks to Michal
	  Weinfurtner for bug report.
	- Added additional status code CU_SMTP_UNREACHABLE which is
	  set if all SMTP servers for mail domain are found as
	  unreachable during SMTP checks.

1.11  Thu Mar  7 19:13:29 2002
	- Fix example in POD documentation.

1.10  Wed Mar  6 01:25:28 2002
	- Added subroutine 'last_check'. Based on patch from Cloyce
	  D. Spradling.
	- Use Test.pm for test suite.
	- Do not treat email address as invalid if SMTP server replies
	  with error on MAIL FROM command.
	- If email is undefined check_email dies instead of
	  omitting warning.
	- A lot of documentation fixes: grammar and spelling
	  clean-up, rewritten section 'IMPORTANT WARNING'.
	  Thanks to Cloyce D. Spradling for patch.
	- Changed my email address from m_ilya@agava.com to
	  ilya@martynov.org in module documentation.

1.02  Fri Jul  6 14:51:06 2001
	- Fixed minor bug in sample code snippet in pod documentaion.
	  Thanks to David Olszynski for correction.

1.01  Tue Jul  3 15:40:40 2001
	- Fixed bug which allowed to pass email addresses with two or
	  more '@' chars as correct.

1.00  Wed Jun 27 19:03:20 2001
	- Added more tests for email address syntax check.
	- Fixed spelling (with ispell) it this file :).
	- Replaced 'validness' with 'validity' in docs. I'm sorry -
	  English isn't my native language. Thanks to Dudley Cadet for
	  this correction.
	- This is 'offical' stable release. Now I'm already working on
	  new rewritten version of this module which will have some
	  new features: OO API, access to DNS resolver object (so it
	  will be possible to set DNS servers for hostname resolving)
	  and many others useful things.

0.92  Fri Mar  9 15:11:34 2001
	- Minor fix: don't get records of type 'IN' in hostname checks
	  via DNS.
	- Value $Mail::CheckUser::Helo_Domain option variable wasn't
	  respected if SMTP server is verified with combination of
	  MAIL and RCPT commands.
	- Added disabling warnings that comes from Net::SMTP in
	  timeout conditions.
	- Incompatible change: Removed old VRFY check. Probably nobody
	  even notice it.
	- No longer putting rfcs into distro.
	- Some minor pod doc fixes.

0.91  Fri Jan 12 19:06:29 2001
	- Added section IMPORTANT WARNINGS to pod documentation. I'm
	  really tired to answer same questions :) Hope this will help.
	- Added $Mail::CheckUser::Helo_Domain parameter. This allows
	  to specify domain name used in HELO query. It can help if
	  SMTP servers doesn't like default domain used in HELO query.
	- Added LICENSE section to README and similar info to CheckUser.pm.
	- Changed resolver behavior: now all domain names are checked in
	  root zone. It means thats email addresses like someone@foo.bar
	  will not be accepted as valid anymore just because your local
	  computer resolves domain foo.bar.mydomain.com and have 'search
	  mydomain.com' in his /etc/resolv.conf.

0.90  Thu Nov 16 16:31:10 2000
	- Removed some tests because some my test mailboxes have became
	  invalid.
	- Some minor pod doc fixes.
	- Marking this release as 0.90 since I believe it has reached stable
	  state now.

0.17  Mon Sep 25 21:06:06 2000
	- Added workaround against annoying warning under Perl 5.6 in
	  Net::DNS module which is used by this module.

0.16  Mon Sep 11 22:44:11 2000
	- Add another check: now module can verify user on SMTP servers
	  using combination of MAIL and RCPT commands. This check can detect
	  validity of mailboxes on more SMTP servers then VRFY check. By
	  default module now uses this new check. Old VRFY is still
	  supported but can be possibly removed in future because it seems
	  there is no need in it if we have MAIL/RCPT check (thanks for idea
	  to Marc Jauvin).

0.15  Tue Aug 29 15:40:28 2000
	- Added some notes about third email address validity check into
	  README and pod documentation.

	- Added into distro rfc 821.
	- Changes in regexp which handles emails syntax (it doesn't allow
	  space in username anymore).
	- Added more tests for emails address syntax.

0.12  Wed Jul 19 20:33:29 2000
	- Fixed bug in SMTP return codes handling (thanks to Rolf Beutner).

	  check_email.
